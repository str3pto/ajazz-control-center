# AJAZZ Control Center Wiki

Welcome to the **AJAZZ Control Center** wiki — the community home for
cross-platform configuration of AJAZZ stream decks, keyboards and mice on
Linux, Windows and macOS.

AJAZZ Control Center (`acc`) is a Qt 6 / C++20 desktop application with
an out-of-process Python plugin runtime (the host spawns a sandboxed
child process per plugin session — bwrap on Linux, sandbox-exec on
macOS). It is an independent, clean-room project and is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or supported by AJAZZ.

<!-- BEGIN AUTOGEN: stats -->
**35 devices** across 1 dongle, 3 keyboard, 10 mouse, 21 streamdeck — 12 functional, 19 scaffolded, 2 probed, 2 partial.

## Screenshots

Material Design QML UI with a `ThemeService`-backed light / dark switch
(Settings → Appearance). Both modes are first-class — pick whichever
matches your desktop.

## Project goals

1. **One app, every AJAZZ device.** Stream decks (AKP153/AKP03/AKP05),
   keyboards (VIA-compatible + proprietary) and AJ-series mice, all in a
   single Qt application.
1. **Every function, every platform.** Displays, RGB, encoders, dials,
   macros, per-app profiles, DPI curves, firmware reporting — on Linux,
   Windows and macOS.
1. **Scriptable.** A first-class Python plugin SDK so the community can
   ship actions faster than any vendor tool.
1. **Transparent.** Clean-room protocols, public captures, reproducible
   builds, signed release artifacts.

## Status

- Alpha — protocols are being mapped and stabilized. Profiles created in
  pre-1.0 releases may need to be re-exported.
- Stable channel will begin at **v1.0** once at least one device per
  family has full feature parity with the vendor tool.
